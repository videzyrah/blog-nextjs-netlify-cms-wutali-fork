## Procedure:

"Brown Pork Sausage in skillet, move to tupperware & drain grease. Boil pasta in 2-3 qt. pot for ten minutes, drain water.\
Combine pasta, sausage, marinara, and ricotta back into skillet"  Warm if Necessary

## Costs:

"As of September 2022 the pasta is 40 cents, the sausage roll $3, marinara $2, ricotta $2.  So, total $8 for about 4 bowls; i.e. roughly $2 per meal for Greg"

## Notes

"The ricotta really does kick it up a notch over simply sprinkling Parmesan cheese but not sure if the added cost/possible leftovers is worth it."
