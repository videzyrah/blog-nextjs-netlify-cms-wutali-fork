**P﻿rocedure**

M﻿ake oatmeal, adding egg halfway through, then add honey and turmeric before you eat it.

**C﻿osts**

I﻿t's probably less than $1.50 of ingredients.

**N﻿otes**

*S﻿avory version of oatmeal, hopefully honey is healthier than sweeting with brown sugar and egg/cheese gets you that protein.*
