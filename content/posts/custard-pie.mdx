## Procedure:

1. In small bowl separate one egg white from egg yolk reserving both.
2. Brush crust (I used the premade Keebler graham cracker crust) with egg white.
3. In large bowl whisk together 3 of the eggs plus the one spare yolk and whatever is left from the beaten egg white , with 3/4 cups sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 2 &1/2 cups milk, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.
4. Pour mixture into piecrust and sprinkle with nutmeg.  Bake for 35-45 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.

## Estimated Costs:

P﻿ie Crust $2, eggs $1, sugar and spices $1, milk 50 cents, vanilla extract 50 cents.  So roughly $5 compared to buying a premade pie for like $6 or $7. Is it worth it?  I would say not unless you have a bunch of eggs/milk/sugar you are trying to use up. Apparently that is the origin of this dish.

## Notes

I﻿ used all milk because I had no cream, and about half brown sugar because ran out of white.
